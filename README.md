Architecture Madness
====================

tl;dr Summary
-------------
This repository contains everything I used to give a presentation on architecture to the Aggieland .NET User Group

 * *master* - Contains only outline and slides
 * *Act-1-Blissful-Ignorance* - Contains the abstraction-free implementation of a simple MonoGame 2D game.
 * *Act-2-Structured-Programming* - The same game, with methods.
 * *Act-2.5-Helpers* - The same game, with methods in helper classes. Intermediary branch (we do not talk about this during the presentation).
 * *Act-3-Objects* - The same game, with objects.
 * *Act-4-Domain-Model* - The same game, with DDD.
 * *Act-5-DSLs* - Not a branch on this repository; exists only in the theater of our minds. See presentation PDF to learn what could have been.

Installing and running
----------------------
Ok, I have to admit--**I'm not sure this will run on your machine.** I spent an hour or so trying to remove the Monogame template and add back everything it did during build, and I failed to produce a reliable "clean machine" build.

So if you want to run the program, download the newest Monogame via their website, install it onto your machine, then load my project and attempt to build.

Consider fixing the build one of my "TODOs".
