Architecture Madness
====================

tl;dr Summary
-------------
This repository contains everything I used to give a presentation on architecture to the Aggieland .NET User Group

 * *master* - Contains only outline and slides
 * *Act-1-Blissful-Ignorance* - Contains the abstraction-free implementation of a simple MonoGame 2D game.
 * *Act-2-Structured-Programming* - The same game, with methods.
 * *Act-2.5-Helpers* - The same game, with methods in helper classes. Intermediary branch (we do not talk about this during the presentation).
 * *Act-3-Objects* - The same game, with objects.
 * *Act-4-Domain-Model* - The same game, with DDD.
 * *Act-5-DSLs* - Not a branch on this repository; exists only in the theater of our minds. See presentation PDF to learn what could have been.
