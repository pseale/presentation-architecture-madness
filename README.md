Architecture Madness
====================

tl;dr Summary
-------------
This repository contains everything I used to give a presentation on  architecture to the CS .NET User Group

 * *master* branch - Contains the outline and slides 
 * *Act-1-Blissful-Ignorance* - Contains the abstraction-free implementation of a simple MonoGame 2D game.
 * *Act-2-Structured-Programming* - The same game, with behavior cohesively tied together via methods.
